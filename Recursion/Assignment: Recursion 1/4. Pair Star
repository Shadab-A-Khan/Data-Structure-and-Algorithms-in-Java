Given a string S, compute recursively a new string where identical chars that are adjacent in the original string are separated from each other by a "*".
Input format :
String S
Output format :
Modified string
Constraints :
0 <= |S| <= 1000
where |S| represents length of string S.
Sample Input 1 :
hello
Sample Output 1:
hel*lo
Sample Input 2 :
aaaa
Sample Output 2 :
a*a*a*a





public class solution {

	// Return the updated string
	public static String addStars(String s) {
		// Write your code here
        if(s.length()<=1){
            return s;
        }
        if(s.charAt(0)==s.charAt(1) ){
            return s.substring(0,1)+"*"+ addStars(s.substring(1));
            //return output;
        }
        return s.charAt(0)+addStars(s.substring(1));
	}
}




since we are doing it recursively

what should be the bse case

see if length is 1 or smaller

there we cannot add any * right



so

here we get the base case

if the lenght of the given string itsefl is smaller then or equals to 1 return the string

ok

?

now

we will check

its sure now if the length is not smaller then or equal to 1 so its min two right



so

we will check if the first and second character that is 0th and 1st are same

we will add 0th char along with an star and contacinate it with the result of

recurison from substring 1

like

if the string is

aaa

so

first and second char is same

so

a*addStars(aa)

else if both are not same

we wont add the * to it

just add the first char 

and then call the recurion next to it
