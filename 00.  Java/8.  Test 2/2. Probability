An urn contains 8 balls : 4 red , 2 blue and 2 green. Now n balls are drawn out of the urn. Calculate the probability that out of n drawn balls exactly x balls are red.
Find your answer multiplied by 100 and return the integer part.
All required values for computation will be in integer range.
x is always less than equal to 4 and x is always less than equal to n.
Input format :
Two spaced integers : n and x
Output format :
Integer part of (Probability * 100). 
Sample Input 1 :
3 1
Sample Output 1:
42
