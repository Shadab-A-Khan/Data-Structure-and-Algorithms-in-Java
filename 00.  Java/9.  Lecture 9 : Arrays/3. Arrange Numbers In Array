Arrange Numbers In Array
Send Feedback
You have been given an empty array(ARR) and its size N. The only input taken from the user will be N and you need not worry about the array.
Your task is to populate the array using the integer values in the range 1 to N(both inclusive) in the order - 1,3,.......4,2.
Note:
You need not print the array. You only need to populate it.
Input Format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

The first and the only line of each test case or query contains an integer 'N'.
Output Format :
For each test case, print the elements of the arra/listy separated by a single space.

Output for every test case will be printed in a separate line.
Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= N <= 10^4

Time Limit: 1sec
Sample Input 1 :
1
6
Sample Output 1 :
1 3 5 6 4 2
Sample Input 2 :
2
9
3
Sample Output 2 :
1 3 5 7 9 8 6 4 2
1 3 2

public class Solution {
    
    public static void arrange(int[] arr, int n) {
        initilize start index with 0 
        initilize the end og the index that will n-1
        initilize the value from 1 , ( because the user have given you n = 7 it will start from 1 and end at 7 like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 )
    
        while(the loop will run untill the start is smaller then the end){
            if(check it is odd or not means divisible by 2 or not and  ***IF ODD ***){
                update array start index with value
                increase the value by 1
                increae the start index by 1
            }else{
                update the value at the end of the arr index
                increase the value by 1
                decrease the end by 1
            }
        }
    }
