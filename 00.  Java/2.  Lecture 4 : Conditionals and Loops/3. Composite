Composite
Your task is to write a function named print_composite that checks if there are any composite numbers up to a given number, n.


Note :
A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. In other words, a composite number is any positive integer greater than one that is not a prime number.
Input:
The function takes an integer n as input, which represents the upper limit of the range to check for composite numbers.
Output:
The function should print composite numbers found within the range from 2 to n (inclusive),
Sample Input 1:
20
Sample Output 1:
true
Explanation:
In this case, the function print_composite is called with n equal to 20. The function returns true because there are composite numbers from 2 to 20.




import java.util.*;
public class Solution{
    public static void print_composite(int n)
    { for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (isComposite(i)) {
                System.out.println(i + " ");
            }
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    private static boolean isComposite(int num) {
        for (int i = 2; i <= num-1; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
