in every question we fighure out the relation better rows columns and the number that is being printed in a patter problem

in this problem

we are doing the same thing

if the user given value is 

5

sample input 1

so there are 5 rows and 5 colums

so we will use a loop

that will run 5 times for all the rows

and nested loop that will 5 time for all the column of that perticular row

ok

?

so


k

see the vaue that is being printed

if you are in row

1

the value starts printing from and going till the max value that should be smaleer the or equal to n

so

in first row

we start printing from

1

that is

1 2 3 4 5


k??

now we go to row 2, so we will start priting from 2

2 3 4 5 

here just 4 column got printed

the last clumn remains there should be 5 rows and 5 column , why we stop here ? becuse the 5 == n next value will be greater then n that is 6

so

we will updte the value

to

1

that we were printing

to

1

and the print it

so

it will be like

2 3 4 5 1

third row next is so value will start printing fro  3

3 4 5 1 2

and in fouth row

4 5 1 2 3
and in 5th

5 1 2 3 4
