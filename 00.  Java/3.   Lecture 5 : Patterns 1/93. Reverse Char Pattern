import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		for(int i =0;i<n;i++){
			for(int j =0;j<=i;j++){
				System.out.print((char)('A'+n-j-1));
			}
			System.out.println();
		}
	}
}
	










see in this patter 
if the N=5
there are 5 rows , right?

so use scanner class object  

ask your for an input int value N

and then run a loop n time  , 
so it can print n rows

now obserb the number of column in
each row,
like if we are in row 1 there is 1 column
if we are in row 2 tehre are 2 column
if we are in row 4 there are 4 column
right?

so for column there will be nested loop
that will run i time, that number of row 
times
like i said the number of columns in each
row is equal to the row number , right?


now comes to the print patter
see if N is 5 it printing firfth character from 5

that is 
E and start decreasing

if the N=7 smaple input 1
it is printing 6th chra from A
that is A B C D E F G
so it is strting each column with G
and keep reducing to the prev char by
1 in each itteration 


so we will alswasy print 
char('A'+n-j)

when one row is completed we
will change the line for next row
