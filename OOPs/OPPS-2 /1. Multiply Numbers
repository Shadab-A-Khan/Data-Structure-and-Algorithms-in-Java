Multiply Numbers
You are tasked with creating a Java program that performs multiplication operations on integers. The program should utilize a helper class called "Helper" containing two overloaded methods for multiplication. The main class, named "Main," will take user input for one or more integers and call the appropriate method from the "Helper" class to calculate the product.
simple input :
5
3
7
Sample output :
15
105



import java.util.Scanner;

class Helper {

    static int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }

    static int multiply(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a * b * c;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num1 = scanner.nextInt();
        int num2 = scanner.nextInt();
        int num3 = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(Helper.multiply(num1, num2));
        System.out.println(Helper.multiply(num1, num2, num3));
    }
}
